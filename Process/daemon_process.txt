For simple unix programmers like me, a daemon is just a process 
that runs in the background, usually waiting for something to 
happen that it is capable of working with, like a printer daemon 
is waiting for print commands.


In a Unix environment, the parent process of a daemon is often, 
but not always, the init process. A daemon is usually created by 
a process forking a child process and then immediately exiting, 
thus causing init to adopt the child process. In addition, a 
daemon or the operating system typically must perform other 
operations, such as dissociating the process from any controlling 
terminal (tty). Such procedures are often implemented in various 
convenience routines such as daemon(3) in Unix.


Systems often start daemons at boot time and serve the function of 
responding to network requests, hardware activity, or other programs 
by performing some task. Daemons can also configure hardware (like 
udevd on some GNU/Linux systems), run scheduled tasks (like cron), 
and perform a variety of other tasks.
