I_O_Multiplexing is used in networking in following senario
sol:
1. When a client is handling multiple discriptors ( Normally
a interactive input and a network socket), I/O multiplexing 
should be used.

2. It is possible but rare, for a client to handle multiple 
sockets at the same time.

3. If TCP server handles both a listening socket and its 
connected socket, I/O multipleing is normally used.

4. If server handles both TCP and UDP, I/O multiplexing is used.

5. If server handles multiple services and perhaps multiple 
protocols, I/O multiplexing is used.
